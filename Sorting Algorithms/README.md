## About this project:

This project demonstrates the speeds of four difference sorting algorithms, name Quicksort, Mergesort, Insertion Sort, and Heapsort.
In the Driver.java file, you can edit a value to change how many elements in an array that each sorting method will have to sort to see how it effects execution speed.
