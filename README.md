# Java-Projects

This is where all of my projects written in Java will be stored. To run the projects, download and copy/paste all of the provided files into its own folder, and then run the "RUN.bat" file. The batch file will finish creating the other files needed to run a project in Java, and then it will run the project in command prompt (most of these projects likely won't have GUIs).

As always, please let me know if you have any suggestions for code improvements or ideas for future projects.
